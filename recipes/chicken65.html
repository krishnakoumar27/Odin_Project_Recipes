    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p> A very popular dish from India, this chicken 65 recipe delivers succulent pieces of red hot chicken that are sure to make the mouth water! Serve with white rice or naan bread.
        Chicken 65 is a spicy, deep-fried chicken dish originating from Hotel Buhari, Chennai, India, as an entrée, or quick snack. The flavour of the dish can be attributed to red chillies, but the exact set of ingredients for the recipe can vary. 
        It is prepared using boneless chicken and is usually served with an onion and lemon garnish. Vegetarian variants like "Paneer 65" or "Gobi 65" use paneer or cauliflower instead. While the name "Chicken 65" is universally used to refer to the dish, there are many different theories claiming its origins.

    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken in a medium bowl. Add egg, cornstarch, 1/2 of the minced garlic, 1/2 of the minced ginger, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Mix until chicken is completely coated.</li> 
        <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet and fry chicken pieces until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Set fried chicken aside.</li>

Add remaining garlic, remaining ginger, serrano peppers, cumin, chile powder, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and salt. Add curry leaves and stir to combine. Add chile-garlic paste, ginger paste, and red food coloring. Stir to create a paste. Add water to thin paste slightly.</li>
        <li>Add fried chicken to the the skillet and toss to coat thoroughly. Stir in cilantro.</li>
